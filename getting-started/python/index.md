# Get started with the openEO Python Client

::: danger Important
You need to [become part of the openEO Platform "early adopter" program](https://openeo.cloud/#adopters) to access the processing infrastructure.

This Getting Started guide will simply give you an overview of the capabilities of the openEO Python client library.
More in-depth information and documentation can be found on the [official documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/) website.

The [High level Interface](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html) of the Python client is designed to provide an opinionated, Pythonic, API to interact with openEO Platform. 

:::



## Installation

The openEO Python client library can easily be installed with a tool like `pip`, for example:

```shell script
pip install openeo
```

It's recommended to work in a virtual environment of some kind (`venv`, `conda`, ...),
containing Python 3.6 or higher.

::: tip
For more details, alternative installation procedures or troubleshooting tips:
see the [official ``openeo`` package installation documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/installation.html).
:::


## Connect to openEO Platform and explore

First, establish a connection to the openEO Platform back-end:

```python
import openeo

connection = openeo.connect("openeo.cloud")
```

The [`Connection` object](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#module-openeo.rest.connection)
is your central gateway to
- list data collections, available processes, file formats and other capabilities of the back-end
- start building your openEO algorithm from the desired data on the back-end
- execute and monitor (batch) jobs on the back-end
- etc.


### Collections

The Earth observation data (the input of your openEO jobs) is organised in so-called collections,
e.g. fundamental satellite collections like "Sentinel 1" or "Sentinel 2",
or preprocessed collections like "NDVI".

::: tip Note
More information on how openEO "collections" relate to terminology used in other systems can be found in
[the openEO glossary](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/glossary.html#eo-data-collections).
:::


While it's recommended to browse the available EO collections on the  
[openEO Platform collections overview webpage](../../data-collections/index.md),
it's possible to list and inspect them programmatically.
As a very simple usage example of openEO Python client,
let's use the
[`list_collection_ids`](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.connection.Connection.list_collection_ids)
and [`describe_collection`](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.connection.Connection.describe_collection)
methods on the `connection` object we just created: 

```
>>> # Get all collection ids
>>> print(connection.list_collection_ids())
['AGERA5', 'SENTINEL1_GRD', 'SENTINEL2_L2A', ...

>>> # Get metadata of a single collection
>>> print(connection.describe_collection("SENTINEL2_L2A"))
{'id': 'SENTINEL2_L2A', 'title': 'Sentinel-2 top of canopy ...', 'stac_version': '0.9.0', ...
```

::: tip
The openEO Python client library comes with Jupyter (notebook) integration in a couple of places.
For example, put `connection.describe_collection("SENTINEL2_L2A")` (without `print()`)
as last statement in a notebook cell 
and you'll get a nice graphical rendering of the collection metadata.

### Processes

Processes in openEO are operations that can be applied on (EO) data
(e.g. calculate the mean of an array, or mask out observations outside a given polygon).
The output of one process can be used as the input of another process,
and by doing so, multiple processes can be connected that way in a larger "process graph"
that implements a certain algorithm.

::: tip Note
Check [the openEO glossary](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/glossary.html#processes)
for more details on pre-defined, user-defined processes and process graphs.
:::


Let's list the available pre-defined processes 
with [`list_processes`](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.connection.Connection.list_processes):

```
>>> print(connection.list_processes())
[{'id': 'absolute', 'summary': 'Absolute value', 'description': 'Computes the absolute value of ... 
 {'id': 'mean', 'summary': 'Arithmetic mean(average)', ...
 ...
```

Like with collections, instead of programmatic exploration you'll probably prefer a
more graphical, interactive interface.
Use the Jupyter notebook integration (put `connection.list_processes()` without `print()` as last statement in a notebook cell)
or visit a [web-based overview of the available processes on openEO Platform](../../processes/index.md).

## Authentication

In the code snippets above we did not need to log in as a user
since we just queried publicly available back-end information.
However, to run non-trivial processing queries one has to authenticate
so that permissions, resource usage, etc. can be managed properly.

To handle authentication, openEO leverages [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/).
It offers some interesting features (e.g. a user can securely reuse an existing account),
but is a fairly complex topic, discussed in more depth in the general for the
[Free Tier](../../join/free_trial.md) and the [Early Adopter program](../../join/early_adopter.md).

The openEO Python client library tries to make authentication as streamlined as possible.
In most cases for example, the following snippet is enough to obtain an authenticated connection:

```python
import openeo

connection = openeo.connect("openeo.cloud").authenticate_oidc()
```

This statement will automatically reuse a previously authenticated session, when available.
Otherwise, e.g. the first time you do this, some user interaction is required
and it will print a web link and a short _user code_.
Visit this web page in a browser, log in there with an existing account and enter the user code.
If everything goes well, the `connection` object in the script will be authenticated
and the back-end will be able to identify you in subsequent requests.

More detailed information on authentication can be found
[in the openEO Python client documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/auth.html).


## Working with Datacubes

Now that we know how to discover the capabilities of the back-end and how to authenticate, 
let's do some real work and process some EO data in a batch job.
We'll first build the desired algorithm by working on so-called "Datacubes", 
which is the central concept in openEO to represent EO data, 
as [discussed in great detail here](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/datacubes.html).


### Creating a Datacube

The first step is loading the desired slice of a data collection
with [`Connection.load_collection`](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.connection.Connection.load_collection):

```python
datacube = connection.load_collection(
  "SENTINEL1_GRD",
  spatial_extent={"west": 16.06, "south": 48.06, "east": 16.65, "north": 48.35},
  temporal_extent=["2017-03-01", "2017-04-01"],
  bands=["VV", "VH"]
)
```

This results in a [`DataCube` object](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube) 
containing the "SENTINEL1_GRD" data restricted to the given spatial extent, temporal extent and bands.


### Applying processes

By applying an openEO process on a datacube, we create a new datacube object that represents the manipulated data.
The openEO Python client allows to do this by calling [`DataCube` object methods](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube).
The most common or popular openEO processes have a dedicated `DataCube` method (e.g. `mask`, `aggregate_spatial`, `filter_bbox`, ...). 

There are also some convenience methods that implement
more complex openEO processes constructs is a compact, Pythonic interface.
For example, the [`DataCube.min_time`](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube.min_time) method
implements a `reduce_dimension` process along the temporal dimension, using the `min` process as reducer function:

```python
datacube = datacube.min_time()
```

This creates a new datacube (we overwrite the existing variable),
where the time dimension is eliminated and for each pixel we just have 
the minimum value of the corresponding timeseries in the original datacube.

See the [Python client's `DataCube` API documentation](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube) 
for a more complete listing of methods that implement openEO processes.


openEO processes that are not supported by a dedicated `DataCube` method
can be applied in a generic way with the [`process` method](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube.process), e.g.:

```python
datacube = datacube.process(
    process_id="ndvi", 
    arguments={
        "data": datacube, 
        "nir": "B8", 
        "red": "B4"}
)
```

This applies the [`ndvi` process](../../processes/index.md#ndvi) to the datacube with the arguments of "data", "nir" and "red" (This example assumes a datacube with bands `B8` and `B4`).

Still unsure on how to make use of processes with the Python client? 
Visit the [official documentation on working with processes](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/processes.html#working-with-processes).
:::

### Defining output format

After applying all processes you want to execute, we need to tell the back-end to export the datacube, for example as GeoTiff:

```python
result = datacube.save_result("GTiff")
```

## Execution

It's important to note that all the datacube processes we applied up to this point
are not actually executed yet, neither locally nor remotely on the back-end.
We just built an abstract representation of the algorithm (input data and processing chain), 
encapsulated in a local `DataCube` object (e.g. the `result` variable above).
To trigger actual execution on the back-end we have to explicitly send this representation 
to the back-end.


openEO defines [several processing modes](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/glossary.html#data-processing-modes), 
but for this introduction we'll focus on batch jobs, which is a good default choice.

### Batch job execution

The `result` datacube object we built above describes the desired input collections, processing steps and output format.
We can now just send this description to the back-end to create a batch job with the [`create_job` method](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/api.html#openeo.rest.datacube.DataCube.create_job) like this:

```python
# Creating a new job at the back-end by sending the datacube information.
job = result.create_job()
```

::: tip
It can be annoying to manage and monitor batch jobs via code.
If you want to use an interface for your batch jobs (or other resources) that is easier to use, you can also open the [openEO Platform Editor](https://editor.openeo.cloud).
After login, you'll be able to manage and monitor your batch jobs in a near-realtime interactive environment; Look out for the "Data Processing" tab. 
:::

The batch job, which is referenced by the returned `job` object, is only _created_ at the back-end, 
it is not started yet.
To start the job and let your Python script wait until the job has finished then 
download it automatically, you can use the `start_and_wait` method. 

```python
# Starts the job and waits until it finished to download the result.
job.start_and_wait()
job.get_results().download_files("output")
```

When everything completes successfully, the processing result will be downloaded as a GeoTIFF file
in a folder "output".

::: tip

on [batch job management and downloading results](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-python-client/batch_jobs.html)
